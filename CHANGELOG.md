# Changelog

All notable changes to ChunkHound will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes
- **DeepSeek, Grok, and Gemini require explicit model** — The baked-in default
  models (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`, and Gemini's prior
  fallback/default path) have been removed. Users must now set `llm.model` (or
  per-role model override) explicitly for these providers.

### Added
- **Git diff search** — Semantic search over git history: `--last-n <N>`, `--commit-range <A..B>`, `--commit-hash <hash>`. Available in CLI (`chunkhound search`, `chunkhound research`) and MCP tools (`search`, `code_research`). `--vector-source` controls scope: `diff` (default), `both` (merge with DB index), `db` (DB only). Staged-changes search (`git diff --cached`) is not included in this release.
- **Claude Opus 4.8 support**: the Anthropic provider now gives Opus 4.8 full Opus 4.7 capability parity: adaptive-only extended thinking (an explicit `manual` request auto-resolves to adaptive), effort levels `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, and the task-budgets beta. The pinned `claude-opus` offline fallback was bumped to `claude-opus-4-8`. Fixes a `400 "thinking.type.enabled is not supported for this model"` error when targeting `claude-opus-4-8` with thinking enabled.
- **Websearch CLI command and MCP tool** — New `chunkhound websearch "<query>"` CLI subcommand and matching `websearch` MCP tool let coding agents pull external context into the loop without leaving it. Searches DuckDuckGo, fetches the top results, converts them to Markdown, runs `code_research` over a transient in-memory index of the fetched pages, and returns a single cited answer with local tmpdir paths rewritten back to source URLs. Per-request timeout configurable via `CHUNKHOUND_WEBSEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 600s). `markdownify` and `zendriver==0.15.3` are new core dependencies.
  - **System Chrome via zendriver over CDP** — Rich page fetches drive the system-installed Google Chrome directly through zendriver's raw CDP bindings. No Node runtime, no bundled Chromium download, no `playwright install` step, and no `chunkhound[browser]` extra to opt into — it works out of the box when Chrome ≥124 is present. Chrome resolution probes known install paths and version-checks the binary (zendriver's CDP binding requires `Response.charset`, which only Chrome ≥124 emits); any verification failure (missing binary, too old, unparseable `--version`) collapses to a warning and the urllib fallback rather than raising.
  - **Robust PDF handling** — PDF detection inspects real response headers before Chrome's PDF viewer engages, verifies the `%PDF-` magic bytes (so endpoints returning HTML under an `application/pdf` Content-Type fall through to HTML→markdown instead of corrupting the result set), and refetches PDFs via urllib with Chrome's cookies forwarded so cookie-gated PDFs (signed URLs, session-protected docs) still work — redirects on the cookie-bearing request are blocked to prevent cross-origin credential leakage. Fetches whose rendered markdown is whitespace-only fail explicitly instead of writing zero-byte files into the result set.
- **`chunkhound mcp --read-only` (DuckDB)** — Point an MCP client at a pre-indexed database — shared, mounted read-only, or otherwise untouchable — without risking writes from the indexer or daemon. Regex search still works; writes through the provider raise. Also exposed as `database.read_only`; rejected for non-`mcp` subcommands.

### Changed
- **DeepSeek/Grok refactored to data-driven registry** — Per-provider
  subclasses replaced with a unified `OpenAICompatibleSpec` registry.
  Adding a new OpenAI-compatible provider is now a data entry + a few
  type annotations instead of a full subclass. Net: -527 lines.
- **Vue template metadata schema for v-model directives** — The shape of metadata produced for `v-model` (and `v-model:arg`) directives has changed:
  - Old: `model_modifier` (string)
  - New: `modifiers` (list of strings) + `model_argument` (optional string for `v-model:foo` style bindings)

  The previous `model_modifier` field was already semantically incorrect on many real cases (it was derived from the tree-sitter `directive_argument` node and could not properly distinguish arguments from modifiers or represent multiple modifiers). The new fields are more correct and consistent with how `parse_vue_directive` works. This is a breaking change for any code or LLM prompts that directly inspected `chunk.metadata["model_modifier"]` on Vue chunks. Most other Vue directive metadata keys (`event_name`, `property_name`, `slot_name`, etc.) are unchanged in meaning.

### Fixed
- **Multi-source URL provenance in fact extraction** — URL-backed facts in
  multi-source clusters are now correctly skipped instead of being stored
  with the URL as a file-path, which broke file-scoped retrieval. New-style
  facts missing a `location` field are also skipped instead of defaulting
  to line 1-1.
- **MCP websearch traceback pollution** — Error output from research
  subprocesses strips internal Python traceback frames, keeping only the
  last meaningful error line.
- **MCP string return passthrough** — Tools returning raw strings (e.g.
  websearch results) now pass through as markdown instead of being wrapped
  in JSON objects.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Breaking Changes
- **MCP `search` response format changed to markdown** — The `search` tool now returns lean
  markdown strings instead of JSON objects, with syntax-highlighted code fences, similarity
  percentages (semantic search), and a pagination footer. MCP clients that parse raw search
  output as JSON must migrate to the new format.

### Added
- **`--index-unknown-files` flag** — Files with unrecognized extensions are now indexable as
  plain text (binary files are still skipped). Enabled via `--index-unknown-files` CLI flag,
  `indexing.index_unknown_files` config key, or `CHUNKHOUND_INDEXING__INDEX_UNKNOWN_FILES` env var.
- **Proto, GraphQL, XML, config, and Dockerfile support** — `.proto`, `.graphql`, `.gql`,
  `.xml`, `.ini`, `.properties`, `.conf`, `.cfg`, and extensionless `Dockerfile`/`Jenkinsfile`
  files are now indexed by default. `.env` files are explicitly excluded to prevent secret leakage.
- **`chunkhound.ai` onboarding** — Interactive CLI setup is replaced with guided onboarding at
  chunkhound.ai; local backend is now configured explicitly rather than through prompts.

### Fixed
- **MCP startup HNSW crash** — MCP server no longer fails with a `CreateDeltaIndex` assertion
  on startup against databases missing the unique `(chunk_id, provider, model)` index from v5.0.0.
  HNSW recreation now runs outside the transaction (issue #280).
- **WAL validation HNSW crash** — WAL pre-flight validation now uses in-memory+ATTACH, preventing
  a C++ abort when the WAL contained HNSW operations from a prior session (issue #273).
- **`--db` nested directory bug** — Passing an explicit file path (e.g. `--db /path/to/chunks.db`)
  no longer creates a `chunks.db/chunks.db` nested directory; known DB extensions (`.db`,
  `.duckdb`) are now correctly identified as file paths (issue #215).
- **Parser install hints** — C# error messages now show the correct PyPI package
  `tree-sitter-c-sharp` (was `tree-sitter-csharp`); Makefile shows `tree-sitter-make`;
  SCSS points to `tree-sitter-language-pack` (issue #267).

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-05

### Breaking Changes
- **Config precedence reordered** — Local `.chunkhound.json` now takes precedence over
  environment variables. If you relied on env vars overriding project-level settings,
  use CLI arguments instead.
- **`--config` now overrides local `.chunkhound.json`** — Previously, a project-local
  `.chunkhound.json` took precedence over an explicit `--config` path. Now `--config`
  wins. If you relied on local `.chunkhound.json` shadowing a shared config file, move
  that override into CLI arguments.
- **Missing `--config` / `CHUNKHOUND_CONFIG_FILE` path now raises** — A non-existent
  config file path used to be silently ignored; it now raises `ValueError` with an
  actionable message.
- **`DEFAULT_LLM_TIMEOUT` doubled** — Default LLM request timeout increased from 60 s
  to 120 s for all providers (was already 120 s for Gemini; now uniform).
- **HTTP MCP server removed** — ChunkHound now supports stdio transport only for MCP connections
  - `chunkhound mcp http` command removed
  - `--http`, `--port`, `--host` CLI flags removed
  - FastMCP dependency removed
  - Migration: Use `chunkhound mcp` (stdio) instead. All major MCP clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code) support stdio transport.
  - Rationale: Simplified codebase, reduced dependencies, focused on primary use case (stdio is the standard for MCP)
- **Unsupported file types no longer indexed as plain text** — Files with unrecognized extensions are now skipped instead of being force-parsed as plain text. Files with known text extensions (.txt, .log, .cfg, .conf, .ini) are unaffected.
- **Claude Code CLI default model changed** from `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Users who relied on the default model will see different cost/quality characteristics. Set `llm.model`, `llm.utility_model`, or `llm.synthesis_model` explicitly to retain previous behavior.
- **Anthropic provider upgraded to Claude Opus 4.7/4.6 and Sonnet 4.6**
  - `anthropic` dependency minimum bumped to `>=0.96.0,<1.0.0`
  - Default Anthropic utility and synthesis models changed to ChunkHound's `claude-haiku` sentinel. This is intentional: current Claude Haiku is capable enough for synthesis, is Anthropic's cheapest available Claude model, and Anthropic does not currently offer a true low-cost utility tier. Users who prefer maximum synthesis quality can override `synthesis_model`.
  - Default Claude Code CLI model changed to the same `claude-haiku` sentinel. ChunkHound still honors its Claude env overrides first; otherwise it preserves the sentinel so Claude Code can resolve the latest matching alias itself.
  - Removed module symbols `BETA_EFFORT` and `EFFORT_SUPPORTED_MODELS`. Callers should use the `supports_effort(model)` / `supports_effort_level(model, level)` predicates instead.
  - `thinking_enabled=True` with `thinking_mode="auto"` resolves to adaptive only for adaptive-capable models such as Opus 4.6/4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Mythos. The pinned Haiku fallback remains manual-mode thinking.
  - `anthropic_prompt_caching` defaults to `false` because ChunkHound requests rarely reuse prompt prefixes enough to offset Anthropic cache-write costs. To opt in, set `CHUNKHOUND_LLM_ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_CACHING=true` or pass `--llm-anthropic-prompt-caching`.
  - Invalid `thinking_mode` values and sub-20000 `task_budget_tokens` now raise `ValueError` instead of warning-and-coercing.

### Added
- **Elixir language support** — Full Elixir parsing (32nd language) via tree-sitter-elixir: modules, functions, macros, protocols, structs, specs, and import/alias/require statements.
- **TwinCAT/Structured Text parser** — IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (`.TcPOU`) files for PLC development are now fully searchable.
- **HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Jinja parsers** — Full tree-sitter parsing for web languages: HTML (`.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`), CSS (`.css`), SCSS/Sass (`.scss`, `.sass`), and Jinja templates (`.jinja`, `.j2`, `.njk`, `.erb`, `.ejs`). SCSS preprocessing handles `#{...}` interpolations for correct AST byte offsets. Import resolution is supported for all four languages.
- **Grok (xAI) LLM provider** — xAI Grok models are now supported for deep code research via the `code_research` tool.
- **Matryoshka embeddings** — OpenAI and VoyageAI providers now support Matryoshka truncation for flexible vector dimensions; default OpenAI model upgraded to `text-embedding-3-large`.
- **`openai_compatible` embedding provider** — Connect any OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint with configurable SSL verification, auth, and dimension support.
- **Azure OpenAI embeddings** — Native Azure OpenAI embedding support with `azure_endpoint`, `api_version`, and `azure_deployment` configuration options.
- **VoyageAI ranking support** — VoyageAI provider now supports reranking for improved search result quality.
- **Claude Opus 4.7 / Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 support** — Adaptive thinking mode (auto / off / manual / adaptive selector), expanded effort levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` (Opus 4.7 only), `max` (4.6+)), opt-in prompt caching with configurable TTL (`5m` / `1h`), and the task-budgets beta (Opus 4.7 only, advisory cap for agentic loops, min 20000 tokens).
- **New `LLMConfig` fields** — `anthropic_thinking_mode`, `anthropic_thinking_display`, `anthropic_prompt_caching`, `anthropic_cache_ttl`, `anthropic_task_budget_tokens` (and matching `CHUNKHOUND_LLM_ANTHROPIC_*` env vars and `--llm-anthropic-*` CLI flags). The pre-existing `anthropic_thinking_enabled`, `anthropic_thinking_budget_tokens`, `anthropic_interleaved_thinking`, `anthropic_effort`, `anthropic_context_management_enabled`, and `anthropic_clear_*` fields are now also readable from env and CLI.
- **Embedded SQL detection** — SQL embedded in string literals is detected and indexed by default across Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, and PHP. Disable with `--no-detect-embedded-sql` or `CHUNKHOUND_INDEXING__DETECT_EMBEDDED_SQL=false`.
- **OpenAI Responses API** — Deep code research now supports reasoning models (gpt-5.1, gpt-5.1-codex, o-series, gpt-5-pro) via the Responses API, with automatic routing based on model compatibility across 30+ models.
- **Reasoning effort control** — Configurable LLM reasoning effort (`none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`) for deep research via `CHUNKHOUND_LLM_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` with per-role overrides.
- **Structured JSON output** — Responses API maintains schema validation consistency across both Chat Completions and Responses endpoints.
- **Multi-client MCP daemon** — Multiple MCP clients can share a single DuckDB connection via a background daemon, eliminating lock conflicts in multi-session workflows.
- **`--perf-diagnostics` mode** — `chunkhound index --perf-diagnostics` collects per-batch timing metrics and detects performance regressions via linear regression and z-score analysis, outputting a JSON diagnostics file.
- **`--path-filter` for research** — `chunkhound research --path-filter <dir>` scopes deep code research to a subdirectory.
- **PHP config-literal parsing** — PHP files with top-level `return [...]` arrays are now searchable.
- **Universal config-literal parsing** — Exported configuration objects and arrays in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX/TSX are now discoverable through semantic search.
- **Watchman live-indexing operator docs** — Documents the private `.chunkhound/watchman/` sidecar, fail-fast startup/no-implicit-fallback behavior, `daemon_status` health interpretation, and the rollout/default-switch gate for making Watchman the primary backend.
- **Dart language support** — `.dart` files are now fully searchable via tree-sitter parsing: classes, functions, methods, constructors, and import/export statements (33rd language).
- **Lua language support** — `.lua` files are now parsed and indexed via tree-sitter, covering functions, tables, and module patterns.
- **T-SQL (SQL Server) parser** — SQL Server T-SQL (`.sql`) files are now fully parsed and searchable via tree-sitter.
- **`chunkhound autodoc` command** — Generates a static Astro documentation site from codebase research, with provenance citations linked to source references and byte-stable output across platforms.
- **`chunkhound codemap` command** — Maps areas of interest (POIs) in a codebase through deep code research; the `-j` flag enables parallel POI processing with automatic backoff to serial on failure.
- **Configurable disk storage limit** — `database.max_disk_usage_mb` config option (`--max-disk-usage-gb` CLI flag, `CHUNKHOUND_DATABASE__MAX_DISK_USAGE_GB` env var) caps database growth and raises a clear error instead of filling the disk.
- **Anthropic native structured outputs** — Anthropic provider now uses the `structured-outputs-2025-11-13` beta API for guaranteed schema-compliant JSON via constrained decoding, with type-safe Pydantic model responses and extended thinking compatibility.
- **Global gitignore support** — ChunkHound now reads the user's global gitignore file (via `git config --global core.excludesFile`) when building the exclusion list during indexing.

### Changed
- **Watchman default backend** — Watchman is now the default realtime backend on supported native-runtime platforms; `watchdog` and `polling` remain explicit fallback backends.

### Enhanced
- **MCP tool routing** — `code_research` and `search` tool descriptions rewritten for improved LLM routing; cross-references between tools are shown or hidden dynamically based on whether an LLM provider is configured.
- **Daemon overlap guard** — A user-scoped daemon registry is now validated against each project's `daemon.lock` before startup, preventing live parent/child root overlaps (e.g., running daemons for `/workspace` and `/workspace/project` simultaneously). Exact-root reuse across restarts is preserved; sibling roots are allowed.
- **`ChunkType.IMPORT`** — Import statements across all languages now use a dedicated chunk type instead of falling through to `UNKNOWN`, improving search precision.
- **Chunk size enforcement** — All parsers now enforce a central size guard before DB persistence; oversized chunks are split automatically, preventing embedding API failures.
- **Windows compatibility** — Cross-platform temp directory handling for Claude Code CLI provider; `shutil.which` replaces Unix-only `which` for git binary detection.
- **Version management** — Supports PEP 440 pre-release formats (alpha, beta, RC) with safety checks to prevent accidental releases from uncommitted work.
- **Multi-client MCP daemon — index lock conflict handling** — `chunkhound index` now detects a running daemon's lock file on DuckDB conflict: a healthy daemon prints an informational message and exits cleanly; an unresponsive daemon prompts the user to kill it and retry.
- **Python import resolution** — Import statements are now resolved more accurately in Python code research, improving cross-file symbol discovery.

### Performance
- **LanceDB dimension detection** — Table creation now detects embedding dimensions upfront from the configured provider, eliminating the O(n) table recreation penalty during first embedding insertion for large codebases (e.g. 16,000+ chunks no longer require full table migration).

### Fixed
- **Cross-repo data loss** — Re-indexing a subdirectory in a shared workspace no longer deletes other repositories' data from the database (fixes #87).
- **Global gitignore false exclusions** — `~/.gitignore` was incorrectly used as a global excludes fallback, causing all files to be excluded when a dotfiles repo contained broad patterns like `*` (fixes #216).
- **MCP startup error visibility** — DuckDB lock conflicts and config validation errors now surface as JSON-RPC error responses instead of silently exiting, with a specific hint to kill stale processes on lock conflicts.
- **Gemini LLM timeout** — All `code_research` calls no longer fail immediately; the 120s timeout was being passed as 120ms to the google-genai SDK.
- **Gemini LLM initialization** — Gemini provider no longer fails to register when `base_url` is present in config, restoring `code_research` availability.
- **VoyageAI `api_base`→`base_url`** — voyageai ≥0.3.7 renamed the parameter; ChunkHound now detects the correct key at runtime, preventing Azure ML endpoint rejections.
- **`tree-sitter-language-pack` 1.0.0 incompatibility** — Pinned to `<1.0.0` to prevent fresh installs from pulling the breaking release that made YAML, MATLAB, Swift, and other language-pack parsers fail at startup.
- **Global chunk deduplication** — YAML and Universal parsers now participate in chunk deduplication, preventing duplicate chunk IDs that caused indexing failures on repeated config values.
- **`hdbscan` startup crash under numpy 2.x** — Replaced `hdbscan` package (which uses the numpy 1.x ABI) with `sklearn.cluster.HDBSCAN` (already a dependency), eliminating MCP daemon startup failures on systems running numpy 2.x.
- **Windows MCP unicode safety** — MCP server stdout on Windows is now reconfigured with `errors='backslashreplace'` to prevent crashes when source files contain non-UTF-8 bytes; applied to both `main()` and `main_sync()` entry points (fixes #225).
- **HDBSCAN outlier cluster assignment** — Outliers in Phase 2 cluster merging were mapped to incorrect final cluster indices, causing code research results to be grouped with unrelated code. Fixed by threading the cluster-id-to-final-index mapping through the outlier merge step.
- **Symlink path preservation** — Worktree and repository symlink paths are now stored as their symlink paths during indexing instead of being silently resolved to their targets (fixes #102).

### Removed
- **`CHUNKHOUND_EMBEDDING_OPTIMIZATION_BATCH_FREQUENCY`** — Database optimization now runs once at indexing end; the per-batch frequency config option is removed.
