<mission>
Produce actionable analysis enabling readers to:
- Understand core mechanisms without re-reading the source
- Trace workflows, boundaries, and recurring patterns
- Apply insights to their own context
</mission>

<audience>
AI agents with limited context capacity. Prioritize understanding over completeness:
- **Curated**: 3-5 most significant mechanisms, not exhaustive
- **Rationale**: WHY decisions made, not just WHAT
- **Trade-offs**: What was sacrificed and why
- **Transformations**: Information flow end-to-end
- **Prioritization**: Most critical concepts first
</audience>

<reasoning_strategy>
**Chain of Draft: Think efficiently before writing**

Use minimal draft notes (5-7 words max per step) to analyze before producing output:

**Draft thinking process:**
1. Scan entry points → identify main workflows
2. Extract core mechanisms → note boundaries
3. Map key values → value, location, purpose
4. Identify patterns → problem solved, trade-offs
5. Trace pipeline → inputs through transformations to outputs
6. Synthesize structure → organization, layers, principles

**Example - Analyzing a search mechanism:**

Draft notes:
- "Entry: BFSExplore._explore() — main entry point"
- "Process: while queue, pop → score → accumulate results"
- "Boundary: quality < threshold → stop expansion"
- "Key figures: rate_limit=1000, burst_size=2000, penalty_duration=60s"
- "Pattern: adaptive depth, prevents context degradation"
- "Trade-off: completeness vs speed, chose bounded limit"

Then produce full analysis with complete details, reference citations [N], step-by-step breakdown.

**Key principle:** Think in concise drafts, write comprehensive output.

<requirements>
1. {CITATION_REQUIREMENTS}

2. **Structure First**: Big-picture view before details
   - Organization, hierarchy, core principles
   - Diagrams for relationships

3. **Core Mechanisms**: Step-by-step breakdown for 3-5 most significant
   - Real names, exact values with source locations
   - Boundary conditions, complexity characteristics
   - Why this approach vs alternatives

4. **Patterns**: Named, reusable with rationale
   - What problem solved, trade-offs accepted
   - Where applied, when appropriate vs overkill

5. **Key Values**: Consolidated tables by category
   - Name, value, purpose, location

6. **Transformations**: Numbered pipeline steps
   - Input → Operation → Output
   - Complete flow from raw input to final output

<approach>
1. Identify 3-5 most significant mechanisms (curated, not exhaustive)
2. Start with the big picture before details
3. For patterns: explain WHY and TRADE-OFFS

REASONING APPROACH:
First, analyze the source material using Chain of Draft (minimal draft notes, 5-7 words per insight):
- Identify entry points and core mechanisms
- Extract key values with locations
- Note patterns and trade-offs
- Map transformations

Then write full analysis following the format specification.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract EXACT values with names and cite using reference numbers [N]
- Use ONLY the reference numbers from the Source References table above
- Focus on structural understanding (AI agents retrieve additional fragments on-demand)
- Curate 3-5 most significant mechanisms, not all mechanisms
- Explain WHY for every pattern and TRADE-OFFS accepted
- Start with the big picture before component details"""
