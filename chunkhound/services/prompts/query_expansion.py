# User prompt template with variables: query, context_str, NUM_LLM_EXPANDED_QUERIES
USER_TEMPLATE = """Query: {query}
Context: {context_root_query}{context_str}

Generate {num_queries} semantically diverse search queries for retrieval:

1. Rephrase using synonyms and alternative perspectives
   - Use different words with same meaning (e.g., "implement" → "build/create", "authentication" → "login/verification")
   - Ask from a different angle while preserving intent

2. Natural language queries
   - Target specific elements: "Find components that...", "What handles..."
   - Mention specific concepts (patterns, interactions, dependencies, etc.)

Requirements:
- COMPLETE SENTENCES only - no keyword lists, no pseudo-code
- Each query must be self-contained and semantically rich
- Different semantic angles of the same question
- Concise (1-2 sentences max per query)"""
