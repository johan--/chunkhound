This package hosts platform-specific Watchman runtime payloads for ChunkHound.

Current native support is intentionally narrow:
- Linux `x86_64` ships an upstream native Watchman daemon payload plus the
  shared libraries it needs at runtime.
- Windows `x86_64` ships an upstream native Watchman daemon payload plus the
  helper executables and DLLs it needs at runtime.
- macOS intentionally ships no Watchman runtime slot in this rollout and must
  stay on the fallback realtime backends instead of `backend=watchman`
  (`watchdog` by default, `polling` as an explicit fallback).

The Python bridge remains in this package only as an internal compatibility
implementation; it does not satisfy the epic's native-daemon closure criteria.

Packaging decision:
- Wheels that carry this package must be platform-specific.
- Publishing a Watchman-carrying `py3-none-any` wheel is forbidden.
- Release and validation lanes opt into packaged-runtime wheel hydration
  explicitly; when that mode is enabled, any host outside the declared Linux
  and Windows support matrix must fail instead of silently producing a native
  runtime artifact. macOS remains fallback-only until a separate macOS-native
  follow-up exists.
- Ordinary source installs, built sdists, and editable installs do not ship
  these native payloads, so they default to fallback realtime backends unless
  operators explicitly opt into `backend=watchman` and allow runtime hydration
  from the pinned sources.
- Those source/sdist installs may build a local generic fallback-capable wheel
  as an installation byproduct, but it is not a supported release artifact.
- Source-hydration downloads use bounded timeout/retry settings and fail fast
  on repeated network stalls instead of hanging indefinitely.
