    Contract:
    - Success: exactly 3 queries — the shape the LLM prompt asks for
      (primary + temporal + best-practices). LLM-produced when possible;
      padded from the raw ``query`` (year-tagged, then best-practices) when
      the LLM returns fewer than 3.
    - Individual variants that drop the query's quoted phrases are filtered
      out and the remainder is padded back up to 3 with the same
      quote-preserving fallbacks. When every variant drops quotes, the raw
      ``query`` seeds slot 0 and the pad fills slots 1-2 the same way.
    - When ``previous_query`` is set, the expansion prompt steers the LLM
      toward *new* dimensions relative to the prior topic. Empty string is
      coerced to ``None`` — no chaining, baseline prompt path.
    - Fallback to ``[query]`` when ``llm_manager`` is ``None`` or the LLM
      call raises.
    - Structural hardening only, not full injection defense: a fixed list of
      the prompt template's own tag literals (e.g. ``</query>``,
      ``</CURRENT_CONTEXT>``) is stripped from ``query`` and ``previous_query``
      before rendering (logged at DEBUG when any literal is removed), so a
      crafted input can't terminate a delimiter and pose as a new section. Any
      other adversarial content in the body still reaches the LLM as-is —
      callers must not treat the returned queries as trusted.
