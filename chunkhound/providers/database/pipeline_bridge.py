    Phase 0 (current): intentionally NOT wired into any production code path.
    The class and the native extension are exercised only by the tests in
    tests/test_rust_db_writer.py.  No production writes go through this class yet.

    Phase 1 (TODO): wire into SerialDatabaseExecutor
    (chunkhound/providers/database/serial_executor.py) to replace the Python
    DuckDB write path — see the db_writer branch for the implementation plan.

    Error-behaviour contract
    ------------------------
    ``write_batch``, ``needs_compaction``, and ``run_compaction`` raise
    ``RuntimeError`` when the writer is unavailable — callers must guard with
    ``available()`` before calling them.

    ``drop_all_hnsw_indexes`` and ``ensure_all_hnsw_indexes`` are intentional
    no-ops when unavailable; they are optional bulk-mode performance hints and
    safe to call unconditionally.
